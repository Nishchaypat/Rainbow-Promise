        <h2>About Same-Sex Marriage</h2>
        <p class="about-text">The legal acknowledgment and union of two people who are the same gender is referred to as
          a same-sex marriage. In recent years, it has been the subject of intense social and political discussion all
          around the world. A significant step toward obtaining more equality and human rights for LGBTQ+ people has
          been the acceptance of same-sex marriage.
          Advocates have been working relentlessly to win legal approval and recognition for same-sex couples during the
          long and challenging battle for same-sex marriage. To ensure that all people get the same legal rights and
          protections under the law, as well as to end discrimination, there has been a push for marriage equality.
          Same-sex unions are now permitted and regarded as fundamental rights in many nations. For the LGBTQ+
          community, this represents a big win because it gives same- sex couples access to a variety of legal
          advantages and protections. But the battle for marriage equality continues because same-sex unions are still
          forbidden in many nations. <br>
          Same-sex marriage recognition is a social and cultural problem in addition to a legal one. It promotes greater
          acceptance and inclusivity and questions conventional ideas about gender roles and relationships. The
          possibility of same-sex marriage having a beneficial effect on the lives and wellbeing of LGBTQ+ people by
          enabling them to live honestly and freely without worrying about prejudice or discrimination.All things
          considered, the legalization of same-sex unions is a huge step toward achieving more equality and human rights
          for all people, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. We must keep pushing for the
          acceptance of same-sex unions all across the world as the campaign for marriage equality continues.

        <h2>Legal Status of Same-Sex Marriage</h2>
        <p class="legal-text">Around the world, same-sex marriage has varying legal statuses. While same-sex unions are
          now permitted in many nations, they are still forbidden in others. Even while same-sex unions are legally
          recognized in some nations, they do not always enjoy the same privileges and protections as unions between
          people of different sexes. Arguments on both sides of the same-sex marriage debate have been made regarding
          the legal status of same-sex unions.Same-sex marriage is often considered as a fundamental right in nations
          where it is permitted and is given the same legal rights and protections as opposite-sex marriage. This
          encompasses, among other things, the ability to make decisions about one's own health and inheritance rights.
          However, same-sex couples could not have access to these legal rights and protections in nations where
          same-sex marriage is prohibited, which can have a detrimental effect on their lives and general
          well-being.Overall, same-sex marriage's legal status has a big impact on the lives and rights of LGBTQ+
          people. Advocates are fighting to make sure that everyone is given the same legal rights and protections as
          others as the fight for marriage equality continues around the world.

        <h2>Rights and Benefits of Same-Sex Marriage</h2>
        <p class="rights-text"> Same-sex unions are now permitted and regarded as fundamental rights in many nations.
          Legal rights and protections for the pair are one of the biggest advantages of same-sex marriage. For
          instance, same-sex couples may be eligible for tax breaks, medical decision-making authority, and inheritance
          rights. Additionally, same-sex marriage benefits the pair emotionally and mentally. It enables individuals to
          express their love and devotion to one another and to have society acknowledge and encourage that love and
          commitment. Same-sex unions can improve the mental health and general wellbeing of LGBTQ+ people by easing
          societal stigma and fostering inclusivity. In general, legalizing same-sex unions is a big step toward gaining
          greater equality and civil liberties for everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
