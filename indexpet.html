        We, the undersigned, believe that all individuals should have the right to marry the person they love,
        regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation. Denying same-sex couples the right to marry is a
        violation of their fundamental human rights and perpetuates discrimination and inequality.Legalizing same-sex
        marriage would not only provide couples with legal protections and benefits, such as inheritance rights,
        healthcare coverage, and tax benefits, but it would also affirm their dignity and value as equal members of
        society.We urge lawmakers to support legislation that legalizes same-sex marriage and to recognize the
        importance of ensuring that all individuals are treated with respect and equality under the law. It is time to
        end the discrimination and stigma that same-sex couples face and to grant them the right to marry the person
        they love.
